1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:22,590
Today I am going to teach you how to play
my favorite game: massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.

2
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,820
It's the only game in the world that I know
of that allows you, the player, the opportunity

3
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,670
to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds
or less.

4
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,559
This is true, so if you play this game with
me today for just one single minute, you will

5
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:46,550
get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise, pride,
curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder, contentment,

6
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,120
and creativity, all in the span of one minute.

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
So this sounds pretty good, right?

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
Now you're willing to play.

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,210
In order to teach you this game, I'm going
to need some volunteers to come up onstage

10
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,940
really quickly, and we're going to do a little
hands-on demo.

11
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,309
While they're coming up, I should let you
know, this game was invented 10 years ago

12
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,309
by an artists' collective in Austria named
Monochrom.

13
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,280
So thank you, Monochrom.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,820
Okay, so most people are familiar with traditional,
two-person thumb-wrestling.

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,100
Sunni, let's just remind them.

16
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,600
One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb war,
and we wrestle, and of course Sunni beats

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,780
me because she's the best.

18
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,050
Now the first thing about massively multiplayer
thumb-wrestling, we're the gamer generation.

19
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,870
There are a billion gamers on the planet now,
so we need more of a challenge.

20
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,270
So the first thing we need is more thumbs.

21
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,990
So Eric, come on over.

22
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:37,230
So we could get three thumbs together, and
Peter could join us.

23
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,030
We could even have four thumbs together, and
the way you win is you're the first person

24
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,720
to pin someone else's thumb.

25
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,870
This is really important.

26
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,240
You can't, like, wait while they fight it
out and then swoop in at the last minute.

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,530
That is not how you win.

28
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,530
Ah, who did that?

29
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,530
Eric you did that.

30
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,530
So Eric would have won.

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,630
He was the first person to pin my thumb.

32
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,260
Okay, so that's the first rule, and we can
see that three or four is kind of the typical

33
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,060
number of thumbs in a node, but if you feel
ambitious, you don't have to hold back.

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,140
We can really go for it.

35
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,330
So you can see up here.

36
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,500
Now the only other rule you need to remember
is, gamer generation, we like a challenge.

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,040
I happen to notice you all have some thumbs
you're not using.

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,230
So I think we should kind of get some more
involved.

39
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,430
And if we had just four people, we would do
it just like this, and we would try and wrestle

40
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,249
both thumbs at the same time.

41
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:26,249
Perfect.

42
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:30,689
Now, if we had more people in the room, instead
of just wrestling in a closed node, we might

43
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:33,569
reach out and try and grab some other people.

44
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,120
And in fact, that's what we're going to do
right now.

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,409
We're going to try and get all, something
like, I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room

46
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,900
connected in a single node.

47
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,650
And we have to connect both levels, so if
you're up there, you're going to be reaching

48
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,569
down and reaching up.

49
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,599
Now — (Laughter) — before we get started
-- This is great.

50
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,109
You're excited to play.

51
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,700
— before we get started, can I have the
slides back up here really quick, because

52
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,910
if you get good at this game, I want you to
know there are some advanced levels.

53
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,890
So this is the kind of simple level, right?

54
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,640
But there are advanced configurations.

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,709
This is called the Death Star Configuration.

56
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,269
Any Star Wars fans?

57
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,840
And this one's called the Möbius Strip.

58
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,670
Any science geeks, you get that one.

59
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,999
This is the hardest level.

60
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,420
This is the extreme.

61
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,569
So we'll stick with the normal one for now,
and I'm going to give you 30 seconds, every

62
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:28,319
thumb into the node, connect the upper and
the lower levels, you guys go on down there.

63
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,659
Thirty seconds.

64
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:30,659
Into the network.

65
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,540
Make the node.

66
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,540
Stand up!

67
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,550
It's easier if you stand up.

68
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,900
Everybody, up up up up up!

69
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,389
Stand up, my friends.

70
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,329
All right.

71
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:47,329
Don't start wrestling yet.

72
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:51,919
If you have a free thumb, wave it around,
make sure it gets connected.

73
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,919
Okay.

74
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,870
We need to do a last-minute thumb check.

75
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,859
If you have a free thumb, wave it around to
make sure.

76
00:03:58,859 --> 00:03:59,989
Grab that thumb!

77
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,120
Reach behind you.

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,250
There you go.

79
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,250
Any other thumbs?

80
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,299
Okay, on the count of three, you're going
to go.

81
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:07,749
Try to keep track.

82
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:11,129
Grab, grab, grab it.

83
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:12,129
Okay?

84
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:15,359
One, two, three, go!

85
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:16,359
(Laughter)

86
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,750
Did you win?

87
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,579
You got it?

88
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,169
You got it?

89
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:24,169
Excellent!

90
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:26,620
(Applause) Well done.

91
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,620
Thank you.

92
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,620
Thank you very much.

93
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,620
All right.

94
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,860
While you are basking in the glow of having
won your first massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling

95
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,699
game, let's do a quick recap on the positive
emotions.

96
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,580
So curiosity.

97
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,220
I said "massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling."

98
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,259
You were like, "What the hell is she talking
about?"

99
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,030
So I provoked a little curiosity.

100
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,030
Creativity: it took creativity to solve the
problem of getting all the thumbs into the

101
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,030
node.

102
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,030
I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up.

103
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,030
So you used creativity.

104
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,030
That was great.

105
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,030
How about surprise?

106
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,270
The actual feeling of trying to wrestle two
thumbs at once is pretty surprising.

107
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,940
You heard that sound go up in the room.

108
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,940
We had excitement.

109
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,960
As you started to wrestle, maybe you're starting
to win or this person's, like, really into

110
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,690
it, so you kind of get the excitement going.

111
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,759
We have relief.

112
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,759
You got to stand up.

113
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,550
You've been sitting for awhile, so the physical
relief, getting to shake it out.

114
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,550
We had joy.

115
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,139
You were laughing, smiling.

116
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,139
Look at your faces.

117
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:16,139
This room is full of joy.

118
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,940
We had some contentment.

119
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,380
I didn't see anybody sending text messages
or checking their email while we were playing,

120
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,720
so you were totally content to be playing.

121
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,449
The most important three emotions, awe and
wonder, we had everybody connected physically

122
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:29,449
for a minute.

123
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,300
When was the last time you were at TED and
you got to connect physically with every single

124
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,500
person in the room?

125
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,980
And it's truly awesome and wondrous.

126
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,530
And speaking of physical connection, you guys
know I love the hormone oxytocin, you release

127
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,220
oxytocin, you feel bonded to everyone in the
room.

128
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,539
You guys know that the best way to release
oxytocin quickly is to hold someone else's

129
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:47,979
hand for at least six seconds.

130
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,949
You guys were all holding hands for way more
than six seconds, so we are all now biochemically

131
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:53,509
primed to love each other.

132
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:54,509
That is great.

133
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:57,330
And the last emotion of pride.

134
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,410
How many people are like me.

135
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,410
Just admit it.

136
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,410
You lost both your thumbs.

137
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,270
It just didn't work out for you.

138
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,770
That's okay, because you learned a new skill
today.

139
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,599
You learned, from scratch, a game you never
knew before.

140
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:09,599
Now you know how to play it.

141
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:10,599
You can teach other people.

142
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:11,830
So congratulations.

143
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,530
How many of you won just won thumb?

144
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,530
All right.

145
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,650
I have very good news for you.

146
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,189
According to the official rules of massively
multiplayer thumb-wrestling, this makes you

147
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:22,940
a grandmaster of the game.

148
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,139
Because there aren't that many people who
know how to play, we have to kind of accelerate

149
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:28,340
the program more than a game like chess.

150
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,310
So congratulations, grandmasters.

151
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,210
Win one thumb once, you will become a grandmaster.

152
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,360
Did anybody win both their thumbs?

153
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Yes.

154
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Awesome.

155
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Okay.

156
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,400
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook
status.

157
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,139
You guys, according to the rules, are legendary
grandmasters, so congratulations.

158
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,350
I will just leave you with this tip, if you
want to play again.

159
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,900
The best way to become a legendary grandmaster,
you've got your two nodes going on.

160
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,629
Pick off the one that looks easiest.

161
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:53,699
They're not paying attention.

162
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:54,849
They look kind of weak.

163
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:58,300
Focus on that one and do something crazy with
this arm.

164
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,710
As soon as you win, suddenly stop.

165
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,710
Everybody is thrown off.

166
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,060
You go in for the kill.

167
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,250
That's how you become a legendary grandmaster
of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.

168
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,710
Thank you for letting me teach you my favorite
game.

169
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,710
Wooo!

170
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,710
(Applause) Thank you.

171
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,711
(Applause)
