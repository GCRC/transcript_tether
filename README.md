## FAQ

1. First, to install and deploy the software, you need to enable the youtube Data API v3. 

2. Second, at the first execution, the program will prompt up for you to create the OAUTH2.0 json file. Just follow the process, download the secret.json file and rerun the program with "-c {secret.json}". The json file will be cached to the user.home folder, so that you don't need to enter the secret info at next time.

3. The youtube uploading service has a 20 min length limitation for uploaded video. To remove this limitation, perform the verification on youtube account at "https://www.youtube.com/my_videos_upload_verify"

4. The video should be uploaded to the same youtube account, the youtube account authorizes the API.

5. The youtube channel needs to be enabled, because the tether process upload the video to users' personal channel (Privated).
