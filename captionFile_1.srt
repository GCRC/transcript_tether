1
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:21,890
Here's a question we need to rethink together:
What should be the role of money and markets

2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,230
in our societies?

3
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,960
Today, there are very few things that money
can't buy.

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,390
If you're sentenced to a jail term in Santa
Barbara, California, you should know that

5
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:41,800
if you don't like the standard accommodations,
you can buy a prison cell upgrade.

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
It's true.

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,430
For how much, do you think?

8
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,470
What would you guess?

9
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,690
Five hundred dollars?

10
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,840
It's not the Ritz-Carlton.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,290
It's a jail!

12
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,399
Eighty-two dollars a night.

13
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,350
Eighty-two dollars a night.

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,530
If you go to an amusement park and don't want
to stand in the long lines for the popular

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,140
rides, there is now a solution.

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,890
In many theme parks, you can pay extra to
jump to the head of the line.

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,689
They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets.

18
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,260
And this isn't only happening in amusement
parks.

19
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:28,200
In Washington, D.C., long lines, queues sometimes
form for important Congressional hearings.

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,179
Now some people don't like to wait in long
queues, maybe overnight, even in the rain.

21
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:38,329
So now, for lobbyists and others who are very
keen to attend these hearings but don't like

22
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:44,520
to wait, there are companies, line-standing
companies, and you can go to them.

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,749
You can pay them a certain amount of money,
they hire homeless people and others who need

24
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:54,840
a job to stand waiting in the line for as
long as it takes, and the lobbyist, just before

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,359
the hearing begins, can take his or her place
at the head of the line and a seat in the

26
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,429
front of the room.

27
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:04,829
Paid line standing.

28
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:11,030
It's happening, the recourse to market mechanisms
and market thinking and market solutions,

29
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,400
in bigger arenas.

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,230
Take the way we fight our wars.

31
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:21,530
Did you know that, in Iraq and Afghanistan,
there were more private military contractors

32
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,909
on the ground than there were U.S. military
troops?

33
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:33,069
Now this isn't because we had a public debate
about whether we wanted to outsource war to

34
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:37,400
private companies, but this is what has happened.

35
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,420
Over the past three decades, we have lived
through a quiet revolution.

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:54,939
We've drifted almost without realizing it
from having a market economy to becoming market

37
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:56,489
societies.

38
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,921
The difference is this: A market economy is
a tool, a valuable and effective tool, for

39
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:08,830
organizing productive activity, but a market
society is a place where almost everything

40
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,160
is up for sale.

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:17,930
It's a way of life, in which market thinking
and market values begin to dominate every

42
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:27,360
aspect of life: personal relations, family
life, health, education, politics, law, civic

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
life.

44
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,459
Now, why worry?

45
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:36,849
Why worry about our becoming market societies?

46
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,080
For two reasons, I think.

47
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,999
One of them has to do with inequality.

48
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:51,609
The more things money can buy, the more affluence,
or the lack of it, matters.

49
00:03:51,609 --> 00:04:00,579
If the only thing that money determined was
access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs,

50
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:04,739
then inequality wouldn't matter very much.

51
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:11,079
But when money comes increasingly to govern
access to the essentials of the good life

52
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:20,200
-- decent health care, access to the best
education, political voice and influence in

53
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,970
campaigns -- when money comes to govern all
of those things, inequality matters a great

54
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,970
deal.

55
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:34,830
And so the marketization of everything sharpens
the sting of inequality and its social and

56
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,850
civic consequence.

57
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,540
That's one reason to worry.

58
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:47,860
There's a second reason apart from the worry
about inequality, and it's this: with some

59
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:57,950
social goods and practices, when market thinking
and market values enter, they may change the

60
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:04,650
meaning of those practices and crowd out attitudes
and norms worth caring about.

61
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:12,280
I'd like to take an example of a controversial
use of a market mechanism, a cash incentive,

62
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,350
and see what you think about it.

63
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:23,140
Many schools struggle with the challenge of
motivating kids, especially kids from disadvantaged

64
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,760
backgrounds, to study hard, to do well in
school, to apply themselves.

65
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:35,480
Some economists have proposed a market solution:
Offer cash incentives to kids for getting

66
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,790
good grades or high test scores or for reading
books.

67
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,250
They've tried this, actually.

68
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:47,070
They've done some experiments in some major
American cities.

69
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:53,750
In New York, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C.,
they've tried this, offering 50 dollars for

70
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:00,840
an A, 35 dollars for a B. In Dallas, Texas,
they have a program that offers eight-year-olds

71
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,550
two dollars for each book they read.

72
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:10,590
So let's see what -- Some people are in favor,
some people are opposed to this cash incentive

73
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,220
to motivate achievement.

74
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,800
Let's see what people here think about it.

75
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,460
Imagine that you are the head of a major school
system, and someone comes to you with this

76
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,460
proposal.

77
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,840
And let's say it's a foundation.

78
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,050
They will provide the funds.

79
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,000
You don't have to take it out of your budget.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,860
How many would be in favor and how many would
be opposed to giving it a try?

81
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,550
Let's see by a show of hands.

82
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,990
First, how many think it might at least be
worth a try to see if it would work?

83
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,250
Raise your hand.

84
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,560
And how many would be opposed?

85
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,990
How many would --

86
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,440
So the majority here are opposed, but a sizable
minority are in favor.

87
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,150
Let's have a discussion.

88
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:56,900
Let's start with those of you who object,
who would rule it out even before trying.

89
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,550
What would be your reason?

90
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,190
Who will get our discussion started?

91
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,190
Yes?

92
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:07,360
Heike Moses: Hello everyone, I'm Heike, and
I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation,

93
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,530
so in the respect that children, if they would
like to read, you just take this incentive

94
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,030
away in just paying them, so it just changes
behavior.

95
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,120
Michael Sandel: Takes the intrinsic incentive
away.

96
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,910
What is, or should be, the intrinsic motivation?

97
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,320
HM: Well, the intrinsic motivation should
be to learn.

98
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
MS: To learn.

99
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,300
HM: To get to know the world.

100
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,920
And then, if you stop paying them, what happens
then?

101
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,310
Then they stop reading?

102
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,310
MS: Now, let's see if there's someone who
favors, who thinks it's worth trying this.

103
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:48,320
Elizabeth Loftus: I'm Elizabeth Loftus, and
you said worth a try, so why not try it and

104
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,930
do the experiment and measure things?

105
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,150
MS: And measure.

106
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,180
And what would you measure?

107
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,100
You'd measure how many -- EL: How many books
they read and how many books they continued

108
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,960
to read after you stopped paying them.

109
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,880
MS: Oh, after you stopped paying.

110
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,910
All right, what about that?

111
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:13,120
HM: To be frank, I just think this is, not
to offend anyone, a very American way.

112
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,710
(Laughter) (Applause)

113
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,590
MS: All right.

114
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:25,860
What's emerged from this discussion is the
following question: Will the cash incentive

115
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:34,419
drive out or corrupt or crowd out the higher
motivation, the intrinsic lesson that we hope

116
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:42,010
to convey, which is to learn to love to learn
and to read for their own sakes?

117
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:48,740
And people disagree about what the effect
will be, but that seems to be the question,

118
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:56,010
that somehow a market mechanism or a cash
incentive teaches the wrong lesson, and if

119
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,870
it does, what will become of these children
later?

120
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,550
I should tell you what's happened with these
experiments.

121
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:08,550
The cash for good grades has had very mixed
results, for the most part has not resulted

122
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,220
in higher grades.

123
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,810
The two dollars for each book did lead those
kids to read more books.

124
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,400
It also led them to read shorter books.

125
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,840
(Laughter)

126
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,830
But the real question is, what will become
of these kids later?

127
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,840
Will they have learned that reading is a chore,
a form of piecework to be done for pay, that's

128
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,070
the worry, or may it lead them to read maybe
for the wrong reason initially but then lead

129
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,010
them to fall in love with reading for its
own sake?

130
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:50,250
Now, what this, even this brief debate, brings
out is something that many economists overlook.

131
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:57,420
Economists often assume that markets are inert,
that they do not touch or taint the goods

132
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,680
they exchange.

133
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:05,840
Market exchange, they assume, doesn't change
the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged.

134
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,770
This may be true enough if we're talking about
material goods.

135
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:15,529
If you sell me a flat screen television or
give me one as a gift, it will be the same

136
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:16,529
good.

137
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,320
It will work the same either way.

138
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,840
But the same may not be true if we're talking
about nonmaterial goods and social practices

139
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,420
such as teaching and learning or engaging
together in civic life.

140
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:38,960
In those domains, bringing market mechanisms
and cash incentives may undermine or crowd

141
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:45,140
out nonmarket values and attitudes worth caring
about.

142
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:55,450
Once we see that markets and commerce, when
extended beyond the material domain, can change

143
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:02,250
the character of the goods themselves, can
change the meaning of the social practices,

144
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:11,180
as in the example of teaching and learning,
we have to ask where markets belong and where

145
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:18,380
they don't, where they may actually undermine
values and attitudes worth caring about.

146
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:26,200
But to have this debate, we have to do something
we're not very good at, and that is to reason

147
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:35,680
together in public about the value and the
meaning of the social practices we prize,

148
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,810
from our bodies to family life to personal
relations to health to teaching and learning

149
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,900
to civic life.

150
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,920
Now these are controversial questions, and
so we tend to shrink from them.

151
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:55,210
In fact, during the past three decades, when
market reasoning and market thinking have

152
00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:03,420
gathered force and gained prestige, our public
discourse during this time has become hollowed

153
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,670
out, empty of larger moral meaning.

154
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,390
For fear of disagreement, we shrink from these
questions.

155
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:21,550
But once we see that markets change the character
of goods, we have to debate among ourselves

156
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,940
these bigger questions about how to value
goods.

157
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:33,930
One of the most corrosive effects of putting
a price on everything is on commonality, the

158
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,100
sense that we are all in it together.

159
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:46,250
Against the background of rising inequality,
marketizing every aspect of life leads to

160
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:53,900
a condition where those who are affluent and
those who are of modest means increasingly

161
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,470
live separate lives.

162
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:02,339
We live and work and shop and play in different
places.

163
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,690
Our children go to different schools.

164
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:12,000
This isn't good for democracy, nor is it a
satisfying way to live, even for those of

165
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,110
us who can afford to buy our way to the head
of the line.

166
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,070
Here's why.

167
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:26,430
Democracy does not require perfect equality,
but what it does require is that citizens

168
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,110
share in a common life.

169
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:35,920
What matters is that people of different social
backgrounds and different walks of life encounter

170
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:43,680
one another, bump up against one another in
the ordinary course of life, because this

171
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,900
is what teaches us to negotiate and to abide
our differences.

172
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,720
And this is how we come to care for the common
good.

173
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,910
And so, in the end, the question of markets
is not mainly an economic question.

174
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,980
It's really a question of how we want to live
together.

175
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:12,170
Do we want a society where everything is up
for sale, or are there certain moral and civic

176
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,760
goods that markets do not honor and money
cannot buy?

177
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Thank you very much.

178
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:18,899
(Applause)
